=== LegacyFox ===

Monkeypatching Firefox Quantum to run VimFx

== Installation ==
0. Install/upgrade Firefox from your distribution's repositories
1. Issue `make install` as root, or copy all files to Firefox' install directory
2. Install VimFx from https://github.com/akhodakivskiy/VimFx/releases

== Notes ==
 * LegacyFox is using ESModules and requires Firefox 124 or higher. Check out
   the `v3.3` tag for compatibility with Firefox 68 to 128.
 * Users of firefox-esr on debian need to use the following command:
   `make DESTDIR=/usr/lib/firefox-esr install`
 * BootstrapLoader et al. from comm-central (c.f. `make diff`)
 * Inspired by https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts.git
 * Uses unsandboxed AutoConfig -- watch http://bugzil.la/1514451
