0. Install/upgrade Firefox from your distribution's repositories
1. Issue `make install` as root, or copy all files to Firefox' install directory
2. Install VimFx from https://github.com/akhodakivskiy/VimFx/releases

== Notes ==
 * Users of firefox-esr on debian need to use the following command:
   `make DESTDIR=/usr/lib/firefox-esr install`
 * BootstrapLoader.jsm, RDFDataSource.jsm, RDFManifestConverter.jsm from their
   last commit in comm-central (8a37a90aab4ec643fce1e1ab33984613ce0b492d)
 * config.js: own work (compare mozilla-central 061b97e02ede)
